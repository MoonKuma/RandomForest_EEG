# Introduction of random forest model

### Abstract

â€‹	Random forest is a supervised machine learning techniques based on the combination of **ensemble** ("average" the result of multiple models for overall better performance) and **decision tree** ( predict certain target value based on splitting its features at different stage in a tree-like shape ). Random forest is used both in **classification** (when target values comes from discrete set like soft-max), and in **regression** ( for continuous target value like linear regression). The following introduction illustrate the basic principle, implementation and important hyper-parameters, pros and cons of random forest model. And then compare it with other machine learning model under same and different task condition.
